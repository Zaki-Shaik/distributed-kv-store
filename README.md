# Distributed Key-Value Store (Go)

This is a basic distributed key-value store built in Go.  
The first iteration runs as a single-node in-memory store, designed with concurrency safety and extensibility in mind.

## Features

- âœ… In-memory key-value storage  
- âœ… Thread-safe reads and writes using `sync.RWMutex`  
- ðŸ”œ Pluggable consensus layer (Raft via HashiCorp)  
- ðŸ”œ Multi-node support  
- ðŸ”œ gRPC-based communication between nodes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+ installed
- Git

### Running the Server (Single Node)

```bash
go run main.go
